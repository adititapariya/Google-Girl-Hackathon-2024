#This file contains the NOC environment simulator, which defines the dynamics of the simulated environment and provides methods for interacting with it.

#NOCEnvironment Class:
#Initialization: Initializes the NOC environment with configurable parameters.
#Reset Method: Resets the environment to an initial state.
#Step Method: Executes a given action in the environment, computes the next state, reward, and termination flag.
