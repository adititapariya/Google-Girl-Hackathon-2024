# src/train.py
#This file contains the training script that orchestrates the training process of the DQN agent within the NOC environment.

#Training Script:
#Import Dependencies: Imports necessary libraries and classes from src/.
#Initialize Agent and Environment: Creates instances of the DQNAgent and NOCEnvironment.
#Training Loop: Executes the main training loop, where the agent interacts with the environment, learns from experiences, and updates its Q-network.
